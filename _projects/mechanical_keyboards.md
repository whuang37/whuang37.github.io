I've been working on mechanical keyboards for over three years. The following are a collection of some of my different builds and experiments.

### The Start of It All
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-5 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/keyboards/kb_1_1.jpg" title="My First Build" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

    </div>

I started off ambitious, with a full resolder of a [**Leopold FC660M**](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=358). At the time, the 65% layout was still relatively rare, making the Leopold one of the only feasible options. However, the board was fully soldered together making any sort of customization difficult. I started off with an old and faulty custom someone had made with the board, replacing the shell with a metal case. I desoldered all the original switches and replaced them with **Zealios 65g** lubed with **Krytox 203**. Thus began my journey into keyboards.

### My Current Build

In order to avoid disturbing my roommates, I wanted a fully silenced keyboard for those late night days (every day). And thus my current daily driver was born, a [**KBD67 MkII**](https://kbdfans.com/collections/65/products/kbd67markii-pcb) with **Healios 65g** lubed with **Tribosys 3204** and filmed. The case is dampened with foam. All stabilizers are band-aid modded and lubed accordingly to minimize noise. My roommates better thank me.

### Commission #1

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-5 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/keyboards/kb_2_1.jpg" title="Commission Keyboard 1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-5 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/keyboards/kb_2_2.jpg" title="Commission Keyboard 1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

A commissioned build, focused on portability and ease of use. Fully hand soldered [**DZ60**](https://kbdfans.com/products/dz60-60-pcb) with **Kailh Jades** in a Bamboo case.

### Commission #2

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-5 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/keyboards/kb_4_1.jpg" title="Commission Keyboard 2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-5 mt-3 mt-md-0">

My client was okay with letting me experiment with something new, so I decided to try my hands at a full handwired build. Using a **KBD67 MkII case and plate**, I hand wired 67 **Zealios 67g** filmed and lubed with **Tribosys 3204**. The matrix then fed into an [**Arduino Pro Micro**](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640) and was programmed through QMK. While I don't have pictures, the metal case had to be modified with a little hole cut out for the Pro Micro to fit it in. Forgot the final pictures :(.
