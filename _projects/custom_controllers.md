I play games to mess with the controllers. Not the other way around. Don't get it twisted.

### My Fightstick

As an avid fighting game player, it's important I come with the style to local tournaments. My fightstick is a [**Qanba Pearl**](https://qanba.vip/products/qanba-qanba-q3-ps4-01e-q3-obsidian-arcade-pearl-joystick-playstation-4-brand-qanba) modded with [**Crown SDB-202 MX 30mm buttons**](https://focusattack.com/crown-samducksa-sdb-202-mx-30mm-screwbutton-grey-dark-hai/) clipped to fit into the Pearl and a [**IST Alpha 49S**](https://arcadeshock.com/products/ist-alpha-49s-joystick) korean lever. Special shoutout to [hugs_n_giggles](https://hng-globeblog.blogspot.com/2020/05/fightstick-artwork-past-works.html) for the artwork.


### Another Fightstick

How long does it take for old to be cool? I was asked to save this [**Mad Catz Street Fighter IV Round 2**](https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fighter-FightStick-Tournament-Playstation-3/dp/B002WB20RQ) fightstick and get it compatible for the newest generation of games. We replaced the internal motherboard with a [**Brooks Universal Fighting Board**](https://www.brookaccessory.com/Fighting%20Board/list.html) for use in modern consoles. We cut and moved around internal supports to fit the new board. A hole was then cut out to fit a new back button.

### Sound Voltex Modding

[Sound Voltex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Voltex) is a popular Japanese arcade rhythm game featuring 6 buttons and 2 dials. My personal controller is a [**Gamo FauceTwo**](https://www.gamo2.com/en/product/faucetwo/). The default parts were swapped out with [**Omron D2MV-01-1C3**](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/omron-electronics-inc-emc-div/D2MV-01-1C3/5236584) switches with [**Sanwa OBSA-60UK** and **OBSA-45UK**](https://bluespringexpress.net/en-us/products/sdvx-sanwa-set) buttons. The dials were then slightly modified to be tighter by stuffing the internal dead zone and tuning the code disk.

### Steam Deck Modding

I've probably spent more time opening this thing open over playing with it. My [**Steam Deck**](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) is essentially fully custom, with a full shell swap (complete disassembly), SSD upgrade, and [GuliKit Electromagnetic Joysticks](https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/854122.html). I've been experimenting with optimizing battery life and thermals on the hardware and software side, replacing thermal paste, liquid metal, and thermal pad channels. My deck is also undervolted and overclocked to maximize performance.
