I am a Fourth Year Undergraduate Student studying [Computer Engineering](https://www.ucla.edu/) at the [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/). I am currently a member of the [Human-Centered Computing & Intelligent Sensing Lab](https://hilab.dev/) and the [Roychowdhury Group](https://www.vwaniroychowdhury.com/).

My research focus lies in human-computer interactions (HCI). Broadly speaking, I am interested in the study of how novel technologies affect marginalized groups and the use of interactive technologies in mixed reality and gaming to solve urgent accessibility problems.

Currently, I work at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/) as an Applied Decision Systems and Analytics Intern developing interactive data interfaces and big data analyses. Previously I was a Biomechanics Co-Op at [Intel 3DAT](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/3d-athlete-tracking.html), Data Analytics and Sports Science Project Lead at [UCLA Athletics](https://uclabruins.com/), and a Data Science Fellow at the [National Institutes of Health -- Office of AIDS Research](https://www.oar.nih.gov/).


When I'm not working or writing a website bio, I'm probably modding consoles and controllers, practicing fighting games, training for my next powerlifting meeting, or in a YouTube rabbit hole.
