I am an incoming PhD Student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/) at the [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/) advised by [Professor Yang Zhang](https://yangzhang.dev/) in the [Human-Centered Computing & Intelligent Sensing Lab](https://hilab.dev/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **AI**. I am interested in how we can leverage cutting-edge AI models to build interactive systems to provide personalized assistance that better reflects an individual user's unique needs. My work spans multiple application domains including but not limited to **accessibility**, **augmented/virtual reality**, and **health sensing**.

Previously, I worked at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/) as an Applied Decision Systems and Analytics Intern, [Intel 3DAT](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/3d-athlete-tracking.html) as a Biomechanics Co-Op, [UCLA Athletics](https://uclabruins.com/) as the Data Analytics and Sports Science Project Lead, and the [National Institutes of Health -- Office of AIDS Research](https://www.oar.nih.gov/) as a Data Science Fellow.


When I'm not working or writing a website bio, I'm probably modding consoles and controllers, practicing fighting games, training for my next powerlifting meeting, or at the arcade.
